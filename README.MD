## Prerequisites
- AWS account
- Terraform installed (v1.x or later)
- AWS CLI installed
- AWS Authentication configured (IAM user with Access Key + Secret Key)  
  üëâ See [AWS Authentication](#aws-authentication) for details.

## AWS Authentication

To allow Terraform to provision resources on AWS, this project uses an **IAM user** with programmatic access (Access Key + Secret Key).  

### Setting up AWS credentials
There are multiple ways to provide credentials to Terraform:

1. **Using environment variables**  
```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

2.  **Using AWS CLI configuration**
  Run the following and enter your keys when prompted:
  ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
3.  **Using a credentials file**
Store your keys in ~/.aws/credentials:
```bash
[default]
aws_access_key_id = your_access_key
aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_key

```
## üöÄArchitecture Overview
This project implements a highly available three-tier architecture on AWS, designed for scalability, security, and modularity.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ High-Level Architecture
	Web Layer: EC2 instances in public subnets behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Handles all incoming traffic.
	Application Layer: EC2 instances in private subnets, accessible only through the ALB or a bastion host. Processes business logic.
	Database Layer: RDS instance in a private subnet, secured with security groups allowing access only from the application layer.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Network & Traffic Flow
	VPC: Contains public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones.
	Internet Gateway & NAT Gateway: Provides controlled internet access.
	CloudFront: Delivers content globally with caching and HTTPS.	
	Traffic Flow:
		**User ‚Üí CloudFront ‚Üí ALB ‚Üí Web/App EC2 ‚Üí RDS (if needed)**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Access
	Each layer has its own Security Group.
	Web servers are accessible from the internet; application servers and database are isolated in private subnets.
	Bastion host provides secure admin access to private resources.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Scalability & Cost Optimization
	Scalable: ALB supports auto-scaling of EC2 instances; RDS can scale vertically or via read replicas; CloudFront handles global caching.
	Cost-Optimized: Uses micro instances and default CloudFront/ALB domains to minimize expenses during demo/testing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Setup Terraform Project
1) Created a modular Terraform project with separate modules for VPC, EC2, RDS, ALB, Security Groups, and CloudFront.

2) Defined variables for flexibility and outputs for module reuse.

Example: Module call in main.tf
```hcl
module "ec2" {
  source = "./Modules/EC2"
  public_security_group_ids = module.security-group.web-sg-id
  pub1_subnet_id = module.vpc.pub1_subnet_id
  pub2_subnet_id = module.vpc.pub2_subnet_id
  private_security_group_ids = module.security-group.app-sg-id
  prv1_subnet_id = module.vpc.prv1_subnet_id
  prv2_subnet_id = module.vpc.prv2_subnet_id
  db-sg = module.security-group.db-sg-id
}
```

### Step 2: Deploy Networking Layer
1) Provisioned VPC, public and private subnets, Internet Gateway, and NAT Gateway.

2) Configured route tables for controlled traffic flow.

Example: Public Subnet
```hcl
resource "aws_subnet" "pub1" {

    vpc_id = aws_vpc.vpc1.id
    cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/18"
    availability_zone = "ap-south-1a"
    tags = {
      Name = "Public_sub1"
    }
}
```
 
<img width="1114" height="701" alt=" S3 bucket configured for static website" src="" />


### Step 3: Configure Security
1) Created Security Groups for:

    ALB ‚Üí Accepts inbound HTTP traffic from CloudFront only.

    Web Layer ‚Üí Allows traffic from ALB.

    Application Layer ‚Üí Accessible only from Web Layer.

    Database Layer (RDS) ‚Üí Accessible only from Application Layer.

2) Restricted Public Access ‚Üí Application is accessible only through **CloudFront distribution**, ensuring that EC2 and ALB endpoints are not directly exposed to the internet.

Example: Security Group
```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "websg"{
    name = "web-security-group"
    description = "allow ssh and http"
    vpc_id = var.vpc_id
}

resource "aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule" "inbound2" {
    security_group_id = aws_security_group.websg.id
    from_port = "80"
    referenced_security_group_id = aws_security_group.load.id
    ip_protocol = "tcp"
    to_port = "80"
}

resource "aws_vpc_security_group_egress_rule" "outload" {
  security_group_id = aws_security_group.load.id
  ip_protocol = "-1"
  cidr_ipv4 = "0.0.0.0/0"
}
```

<img width="829" height="511" alt="Uploaded the website file to the S3 bucket" src="" />

### Step 4:Web,Application & Database Layer Execution Process
1) Launched **CloudFront** distribution pointing to the **Load Balancer URL** for global content delivery.

2) Launched **EC2 instances** in public subnets behind an **ALB**.

3) Launched **EC2 instances** in private subnets accessible via a **Bastion Host**.

4) Deployed an **RDS instance** in a private subnet with secure access from the application layer only.

Example: EC2 Instance
```hcl
resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "cdn" {
  enabled             = true
  default_root_object = "index.html"

  origin {
    domain_name = var.lb_dns   
    origin_id   = "load-origin"

    custom_origin_config {
      http_port              = 80
      https_port             = 443
      origin_protocol_policy = "http-only"   # switch to https-only if ALB listener is HTTPS
      origin_ssl_protocols   = ["TLSv1.2"]
    }
  }

```

### Step 5: TestCases
1. Verified application access is restricted via **ALB**, **Web**, **Application**, and **Database Layer**.
2. Validated **CloudFront** delivery for global content caching.
